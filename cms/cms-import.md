title: Configuring Imports and Exports

Handling bulk data in Skygear CMS is easy. Your users can import data with a csv and export data to a csv. 

## Imports

Your users can import data to Skygear with a csv. To do so, you need to configure the import settings and add an import button to the right page.

### Configuring imports

There are a few items you can configure in the import settings, and we are using the following 2 tables to illustrate how.

**Blogpost**
|Fields| Type| 
|---|---|
|_id| String|
|_created_at| DateTime|
|_updated_at| DateTime|
|title| String|
|content| String|
|cover| Asset|

**Comment**
|Fields| Type| 
|---|---|
|_id| String|
|_created_at| DateTime|
|_updated_at| DateTime|
|comment| String|
|blogpostId | Reference|

This is what we need:

1. Allow users to import a list of comments. 
2. We will use `comment` as an indenitfier. When there are two identical comments, they are considered as duplicated records.
3. When there are duplicated records, we will throw an error to the users.
4. To correctly assoicate every comment to a blogpost, we should also input the blogpost's title next to each comments.

```yml
site:
  - type: Record
    name: comment
  - type: Record
    name: blogpost

imports:
  import-comment:
    record_type: comment
    identifier: content
    handle_duplicated_identifier: throw-error
    fields:
      - name: comment
      - name: blogpostId
        reference_target: blogpost
        reference_field_name: title
        handle_duplicated_reference: use-first

records:
  comment: 
    record_type: comment
  blogpost: 
    record_type: blogpost
```

This is what your csv should look like:

|comment| title|
|---| ---|
|Can't agree more| Adele is so adorable!|
|Let's go drinking this Friday! |Today is such a tired day|
|Of course! |Skygear is so awesome|

Configurable items:

- <a href='./#record_type'>`record_type`</a>
- <a href='./#identifier'>`identifier`</a>
- <a href='./#handle_duplicated_identifier'>`handle_duplicated_identifier`</a>
- <a href='./#fields'>`fields`</a>

<a name='record_type'></a>

#### `record_type`
The database table this import is linked to.
```yml
imports:
  import-name-random: 
    record_type: 
```

<a name='identifier'></a>

#### `identifier`
The field that Skygear uses to determine if there are any duplicated records.
```yml
imports:
  import-name-random: 
    identifier: 
```
<a name='handle_duplicated_identifier'></a>

#### `handle_duplicated_identifier`
The way to handle duplicated records. 

```yml
imports:
  import-name-random: 
    handle_duplicated_identifier: throw-error or use-first
```

- `throw-error` will return an error about this record. If you want to reject the whole import when there are errors, you can set `atomic: true` in the `action` setting (will be explained below).

- `use-first` will randomly accept one of the duplicated records.

<a name='fields'></a>

#### `fields`
Fields the users should fill in. 

For relational records, Import support only **reference** (i.e. 1-many).

```yml
imports:
  import-name-random: 
    fields:
      - name: a normal field
      - name: a reference field
        reference_target: the referenced table 
        reference_field_name: the field user should fill in the csv to idenitfy the referenced record
        handle_duplicated_reference: throw-error or use-first
```
- `throw-error` will return an error. If you want to reject the whole import when there are errors, you can set `atomic: true` in the `action` setting (will be explained below).

- `use-first` will randomly assign the record to one of the duplicated references.

### Add the import button

To add an import button to the page, you need configure it in the list view. 

Example usage:

Suppose now we are adding an **import** button on the `comment`'s list view.

```yml
site:
  - type: Record
    name: comment

records:
  comment:
    record_type: comment
    list:
      actions:
        - type: Import
          name: import-comment # this is defined in the import section
          label: Import
          atomic: true 
```

- `atomic`: When `atomtic` is set to true, the whole import will be rejected if there are errors from `handle_duplicated_reference` and `handle_duplicated_identifier`. Default is false.

## Exports

Your users can exprot data from Skygear to a csv. To do so, you need to configure the export settings and add an export button to the right page.

### Configuring exports

Resuing the two databases in the Configuring imports section as an example.

This is what we need:

1. Allow users to export all the comments
2. Next to each comment, we will also show the blogpost title the comment belongs to

```yml
site:
  - type: Record
    name: comment
    label: Comment

records:
  comment: 
    record_type: comment
  blogpost:
    record_type: blogpost

exports:
  export-comments:
    record_type: comment
    fields:
      - name: _id
      - name: _created_at
      - name: comment
      - name: blogpost_title
        reference_target: blogpost
        reference_field_name: title
```
The exported csv will look like this:

|_id|_created_at| comment| title|
|--- |---|---| ---|
|93ab4e95-2cb6-4c00-890e-20038d1be03c|2018-07-09 18:00:56+08:00|Can't agree more| Adele is so adorable!|
|8cbb14e7-0cb0-48c8-a46e-ba1cfb8804f6|2018-07-09 17:59:52+08:00|Getting a drink. Anyone? |Today is such a tired day|
|90534306-48ff-4b38-8b01-6fa53831096b|2018-07-09 17:59:21+08:00| Of course! |Skygear is so awesome|

Export supports also back reference (i.e. many-1). The example below will show you how to configure back reference.

This is what we need:
1. Allow users to export all the blogposts
2. Next to each blogpost, we will also show the comments belong to this blogpost

```yml
site:
  - type: Record
    name: blogpost
    label: Blogpost

records:
  comment: 
    record_type: comment
  blogpost:
    record_type: blogpost

exports:
  export-blogposts:
    record_type: blogpost
    fields:
      - name: _id
      - name: _created_at
      - name: content
      - name: title
      - name: comment_comment
        reference_via_back_reference: comment
        reference_from_field: blogpostId
        reference_fields:
          - name: _id
            label: comment_id
          - name: comment
            label: comment
```
The exported csv will look like this:

|_id|_created_at| title| content| comment_id| comment|
|--- |---|---| ---| ---| ---|
|93ab4e95-2cb6-4c00-890e-20038d1be03c|2018-07-09 18:00:56+08:00|What do you think about the new CMS?|Let us know what you think!| 9opb4e15-2f03-9f00-890e-20037w1bg03c, 6f4cc50c-ac72-45a6-8308-d54ce69a0a3b| Better than the old one., Awesome!|
|8cbb14e7-0cb0-48c8-a46e-ba1cfb8804f6|2018-07-09 17:59:52+08:00|Let's go drinking this Friday! |Today is such a tired day|43c48ee9-558b-43a4-ba85-7e6e3cdd38bd|Let's go drinking this Friday!|
|90534306-48ff-4b38-8b01-6fa53831096b|2018-07-09 17:59:21+08:00|Skygear is so awesome | Don't you think so? | 9196132f-4507-44fd-aadc-e60d76f9ec6d| Of course!|


### Add the export button
Now, let's add an **export** button to the `comment`'s list view.
```yml
site:
  - type: Record
    name: comment

records:
  comment:
    record_type: comment
    list:
      actions:
        - type: Export
          name: export-comments # this is defined in the import section
          label: Export
```
