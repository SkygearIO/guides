## Introduction

Push dashboard allows your admins to broadcast push notifications to your users. You can also segment the users so that you can send targeted push notifications.

Make sure you have enabled Skygear push notification and fill in the information accordingly so that the push dashboard can work properly.

## Configuring the push dashboard

Example usage:

```yml
site:
  - type: push_notifications
    label: Push Dashboard

push_notifications:
  filters:
    - name: username
      type: string
      label: Username
```

`fiters`: It refers to the fields admins can use to filter the users. For example, if you set the `username` field to be filterable, then admins can filter users based on their username and send push notifications to the filtered user list.

Below are the filter types you can use:

- `string`
- `date_time`
- `boolean`
- `integer`
- `general`
- `reference`
