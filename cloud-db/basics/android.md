## Introduction

Skygear allows users to store records to Skygear's PostgreSQL cloud database.
You can even define your own type of `Record` and add customized fields to suit
you needs.

Before you proceed, please make sure:
- You have your Skygear container configured. Simply follows the guide at
[Setup Skygear][doc-setup-skygear] if you haven't.

- You have signed up as a `User` and logged in, as you have to be authenticated
to perform any database operations. For guide on sign up and log in, go to
[User Authentication Basics][doc-user-auth].

To visualize your database with graphical presentation, you can go to the Database section in [Skygear Portal][skygear-portal]
and open our web data browser.

## Record

[Record][api-record] is the data storage unit in Skygear.

- Each `Record` must be given a `type`. Such `type` is simply a `String` property of
`Record` describing the type of data this record holds.
- Each `Record` object contains a `java.util.Map` representing its attributes; Keys will be mapped to database column names, and values will be stored accordingly based
on the data type.
- There exist some reserved keys that cannot be used as a key for an attribute. Examples are `ownerUserRecordID ` and `recordType `. Please refer to [Reserved Columns][doc-reserved-columns] section for more information.
- Each `Record` created will be owned by the currently logged in user.
- Each `Record` object has a unique `id` (a string combination of record type and uuid is used).

## Database
Before doing any record operations, you have to understand how databases
in Skygear work. You are provided with a private and a public database:

- Every record in the private database is truly private, regardless of the [Access Control List (ACL)](https://docs.skygear.io/guides/cloud-db/acl-overview/android/) set.

- Records saved at the public database is set to public by default. ACL can be set per record.

The public and private database can be retrieved using:

```java
// get Skygear Container
Container skygear = Container.defaultContainer(this);

// get public database
Database publicDatabase = skygear.getPublicDatabase();

// get private database
Database privateDatabase = skygear.getPrivateDatabase();
```
```kotlin
// get Skygear Container
val skygear = Container.defaultContainer(this)

// get public database
val publicDatabase = skygear.publicDatabase

// get private database
val privateDatabase = skygear.privateDatabase
```

## Data type
Below are the data types Skygear supports:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Array
- Object
- Date

There are also four other types provided by the Skygear SDK:
- Reference (relational records)
- Asset (files)
- Sequence
- Location

You will learn how to works with these data type in [Relational records][doc-relational-record], [File storage][doc-files] and [Location, Auto-increment Sequence fields][doc-data-type].

## Reserved columns

For each new record type stored in the database, a table with the same name as the record type is created. For example, if your record type is called `Note` which no record of this type has been saved before, a new table called `Note`
will be created. Each row in the table corresponds to one record of type `Note`.

For each record table there exists two types of columns (fields of a record), those reserved by Skygear and those user-defined. Reserved columns contain metadata of a record, such as record ID, record owner and creation time. These reserved columns are prefixed with underscore, like `_created_at`.

It is possible to manipulate data in record tables directly. A quick
way to update or delete records directly is to use our web data
browser. Please note that reserved columns cannot be manipulated this
way, and one should exercise with caution when modifying data directly
in record tables.

Each record table contains the following reserved columns:

| Column Name   | Object Attribute | Type             | Description                           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `_id`         | `id`             | `String`         | unique id of a record                 |
| `_owner_id`   | `ownerId`        | `String`         | user id of owner of a record          |
| `_created_at` | `createdAt`      | `java.util.Date` | creation time of a record             |
| `_created_by` | `creatorId`      | `String`         | id of user who created a record       |
| `_updated_at` | `updatedAt`      | `java.util.Date` | last update time of a record          |
| `_updated_by` | `updaterId`      | `String`         | id of user who last updated a record  |
