Skygear has provided a default security setting on all records.

By default,

- read access is granted to the public, and
- write access is granted only to owner of the record.

Read access includes access to **query** and **fetch**. Write access includes access to **update** and **delete**. More details below.

For example:

```javascript
// not logged in as any user
const Note = skygear.Record.extend('note');
const noteQuery = new skygear.Query(Note);

skygear.publicDB.query(noteQuery).then((records) => {
  console.log('Successful to query Note records');

  const note = records[0];
  note.content = 'Hello World!';
  return skygear.publicDB.save(note);
}).then((records) => {
  // You will NOT succeed
}, (error) => {
  // You will get not Authenticated error here
  console.log(error);
});
```

If you want to customize these security settings, Skygear supports access control on records. You can use it to control whether a user can query, update or delete a record.

Skygear uses [Access Control List][wiki-acl] (ACL) as the model of access control.
An ACL is a list of Access Control Entry (ACE), each ACE describes which
access rights a user target has to a record.

Each ACE consists of:
- **Access level**, which defines what actions can be performed (for example, read or write).
- **User Target**, which defines who can perform the specified actions (for example, a specific user or group of users).


These are the concepts you need to know:
- Record ownership, **the owner has full access** to the record.
- The 2 types of ACL in Skygear: [Record-based ACL][doc-record-acl] and [Field-based ACL][doc-field-acl].

:::tips
When you should use Record-based ACL or Field-based ACL?

If every single record has the same ACL, that the same  have the same access rights to a record, you can use Record-based ACL.

Otherwise, if a set of users have has different access rights for each field of a record, you would need to use Field-based ACL.
:::

Before diving into Record-based ACL and Field-based ACL, let's learn about the basic concepts of Skygear ACL.

## ACL Access Level

There are 3 access levels in Skygear ACL:

- No Access
- Read Write Access
- Read Only Access

This is how you can set it:

```javascript
const acl = new skygear.ACL();

acl.setPublicNoAccess();
acl.setPublicReadOnly();
acl.setPublicReadWriteAccess();

// and more...
```

:::tips

**Read access**

Read access grants users right to *query* and *fetch* records, which includes getting all the fields of a record as well as the ACL of the record.


**Write access**

Write access grants users right to *save* and *delete* records, which includes adding,
updating and removing all the fields (**EXCEPT** [reserved columns][doc-reserved-columns]) of a record as well as the ACL of the record.

## ACL User Target

User Target defines *who* can perform the specified actions. It can be a specific user or a group of users. Below are the types of User Target you can define.

- **Public**: refers to all other users of the app, unauthenticated (not logged in) users included
- **By User**: users specified by User ID
- **By Role**: users grouped into specific roles by admin

Below we will talk about how to create roles and assign a role to users.

### Role Configuration

#### Define role

You can create different roles and later use them to design ACL targeting users of specific roles.

```javascript
// either way of defining roles is fine
const Manager = skygear.Role.define('manager');
const Visitor = new skygear.Role('visitor');
```

#### Admin role

In Skygear roles are either admin role or non-admin role. By default, there is an admin role called `Admin`.

What only admin role can do:

- Assign role to user
- Revoke role to user

:::tips
For security concern, only admin can change the role of a user, thus the user must request another user with admin role to change the role for him.

Do not abuse role to model user grouping. If a group can be joined by other users without requesting permission, that should be a public group, which does not require ACL.
:::


#### Setting admin role and default role in debug mode

You define new roles to be admin role.

```javascript
skygear.auth.setAdminRole([Manager]).then((roles) => {
  console.log(roles); // [ 'manager' ]
}, (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

You can also set the default roles so that newly signed up user would start with these roles.

```javascript
skygear.auth.setDefaultRole([Visitor]).then(...);
```

#### Assign and Revoke Roles

For admin user to change roles of other users:

```javascript
// You must login as an admin user
const targetUsername = ['John', 'Ken'];
const userQuery = new skygear.Query(skygear.UserRecord);
userQuery.contains('username', targetUsername);
skygear.publicDB.query(userQuery).then((records) => {
  if (records.length != targetUsername.length) {
    console.log('Cannot find both John and Ken');
  }

  return Promise.all([
    skygear.auth.revokeUserRole(records, [Visitor]),
    skygear.auth.assignUserRole(records, [Manager]),
  ]);
}).then(() => {
  console.log('John and Ken are promoted from Visitor to Manager');
}, () => {
  console.log('You are not admin user');
});
```

## Changing Default ACL Settings

You can change the default ACL settings:

```javascript
// giving admin role read write access to all new records
const Admin = new skygear.Role('admin');
acl.setReadWriteAccessForRole(Admin);
skygear.publicDB.setDefaultACL(acl);
```

After changing the default ACL setting, all records created in the future
will automatically have this ACL setting; however, ACL setting for existing
records created before this update will remain unchanged.
